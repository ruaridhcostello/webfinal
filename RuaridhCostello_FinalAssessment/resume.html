            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>About Me NEED TO FILL IN</b></h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Ruaridh Costello and I am in my second<br>
                &nbsp;second semester at Seneca College. I'm in the program<br>
                &nbsp;Computer Programming and Analysis. This semester my <br>
                &nbsp;favourite courses were DBS211, taught by Ron Tarr,<br>
                &nbsp;and WEB222, taught by Navreet Lehal. I enjoyed WEB<br>
                &nbsp;because every lesson was very in depth and I was<br>
                &nbsp;able to follow along with the lesson very easily<br>
                &nbsp;and if for whatever reason I was not able to <br>
                &nbsp;understand what was being taught, it was very easy<br>
                &nbsp;to ask questions. This was also the same reason why<br>
                &nbsp;I enjoyed the DBS course. I am excite to learn more<br>
                &nbsp;about both databases and web design in the future. </p>

        <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my second semester at Seneca college, I began the course WEB222. I did not originally think I
             would enjoy the course as much as I did, but around the second day of class I quickly realized that web
             design was something that I would want to develop more as a skill after the course was over. I
             thoroughly enjoyed my professor’s teaching style and I found that the fact that classes were being done
             online made the whole learning process even more enjoyable. It was very easy to follow along with what
             the professor was doing and with the lectures having been recorded, I liked that I was able to look back
             upon past classes in the event that I had forgotten or misunderstood something that was taught. I also
             enjoyed learning JavaScript, as it felt familiar to me due to the similarities between JavaScript and C
             language which I had learned the previous semester. I found it very interesting learning how CSS worked
             and the different ways it could be implemented to help change the appearance of a web page. I’m very
             excited to learn more CSS in the future, as I am heavily considering going into a career path focusing on
             SQL Databases and CSS is also used in the design and management of them. I plan on taking the skills I
             have learned in both this WEB222 course and my DBS211 course and improving upon them both
             through Seneca courses, and during my own free time.
